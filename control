Package: coverity-submit

Description: Submit scan requests to the Coverity demo server.
 If you are a registered user of Coverity's self-build server and have
 the cov-build tools installed locally, this script automates the
 process of running the tools, shipping the and submitting the results
 with an analysis request to Coverity. It can be configured to store
 build passwords, local build commands, and other required information
 for multiple projects so you don't have to remember it - just call
 the tool and let it manage the details.
